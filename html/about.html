        <p> 
            I’m a dedicated professional with a strong academic foundation, holding four degrees in economics.
            My journey has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of financial systems analysis and a passion
            for deriving data-driven insights
            I've worked on various projects, bridging econimic theory and practical application.
            I have recently dealt into Software development from IndianHills Commuty College combining my analytical
            skills with
            technology to create innovative solutions.
        
            I'm currently working on building a personal website,
            where I share my thoughts on economic trends,
            software development, and personal growth.
            My aim is to create intuitive user experience
            while continuously learning implementing new technologies.
            

                In my free time, I love to play soccer and experimenting with new coding languages like Data Analytic and
                Pandas.
                I’m excited about the journey ahead in the world of software development.
                Feel free to adjust any part of it or let me know if you want to brainstorm specific details!
